## Introduction

Keeping track of time and managing daily tasks efficiently can often be challenging. To address this, we aim to create a **Physical Clock with Alarm and Timer**, a device designed to assist users in organizing their schedules with ease. This clock will provide essential timekeeping features alongside customizable alarms and timers to help users stay on track throughout the day.

Equipped with an intuitive interface, the clock will allow users to set alarms for specific events or use the timer for tasks that require precise tracking. Whether it's waking up in the morning, timing a cooking session, or managing work intervals, this project combines hardware and software to deliver a reliable and user-friendly time management solution.

This project aims to enhance everyday productivity and provide a practical tool that integrates seamlessly into the user's routine.
